Example code for using the e-Paper driver to display images. This code does not use any wireless functionality, it is purely a driver demonstration.

This example goes through a typical sequence for displaying an image on the e-Paper display:
Power on, initialisation, clearing the display, displaying an image, and finally going into sleep mode.
