# FreeRTOS Demo - Secure Binary #

This TrustZone binary features the secure code necessary to boot a TrustZone-enabled application and provide it with the services needed to run FreeRTOS securely. It also contains several example non-secure entry functions, secure functions that can be called from non-secure code.

For instructions on how to use this secure binary alongside an application, see the documentation for `freertos-demo`.
